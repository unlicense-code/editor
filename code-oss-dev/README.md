## Importent: Auto Build
This is designed to build a dependencie bundle and offer wrappers to reuse that.
Most of the code gets autogenerated the /build/repo folder should not get modifyed directly
instead update ./build/ and ./ remember when you create a file here it will auto replace
the bad dependencie.
