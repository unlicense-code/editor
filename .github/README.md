# Editors and Tools

## CodeUP a rollup fork designed to deploy code-oss
Rollup is a Loader Hook System that is highly flexible it gives you a consistent way to describe build steps that depend on
a variaty of none pre known dependencies. So it is Ideal to load Legacy code and use it as Packaging Pipeline. It also got
a lot of Support from existing libs that are coded in a compatible way for this hook system eg vite stuff.

## chromium-fs 
A Collection of FileManagement Tools for the Chromium Platform

## Isolated Web App Bundle and Build Tools
Contains a WDA Web Driven Application WDA is a standard invented by Frank Lemanschik it consists mainly out of methods to incremental upgrade 
and deploy applications that can transition from Web Served Applications to local Installed Applications without user frustration aka Installation
It uses serviceWorker Caches and the OPFS to Archive this magic it contains instructions to build and run a variaty of Default Application
Setups. Like Running in a Standalone Window like Electron using nativMessaging and a local running "awesomeos" Executable binary or WebRTC and a 
native running awesomeos executeable where awesomeos is a special build of Components and a Component Capability based Protocol Pattern to 
Compose Operating Systems out of WDA Specification Compilant Applications. 

Together with the unlicensed-code/editor AwesomeOS gets first class support for Code OSS the Famous Editor that powers products like
VSCODE, Theia, VSCODE_WEB, Github, Gitlab, and many many many many many more............

This makes it a AwesomeOS Integrated Development Environment. AwesomeOS - IDE

The main advantage is that it is really device and platform indipendent code that does not need to install anything else then the Chromium Stack
Partial or fully. The Smallest deployments consist out of B8G which is a special minimum V8 Build designed to replace kernel level 0 ring 0 so 
directly the Operating System bindings to the Hardware. It Compiles Applications via special Linking of Application Memory and advanced Isolation
for Security while it is able to Transport data Cross Application via so called Handels. 

for a demo build of a small test framework that uses such a v8 build but hardcoded for easyer reading as also linux only is the so called JustJS Project which ranks since ages 
on Rank1 in reputable benchmarks like TechEmpower Framework Benchmark above Rust above Java above many evil optimized c++ frameworks.
