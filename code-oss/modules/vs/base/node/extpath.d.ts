 * Given an absolute, normalized, and existing file path 'realcase' returns the exact path that the file has on disk.
 * On a case insensitive file system, the returned path might differ from the original path by character casing.
 * On a case sensitive file system, the returned path will always be identical to the original path.
 * In case of errors, null is returned. But you cannot use this function to verify that a path exists.
 * realcaseSync does not handle '..' or '.' path segments and it does not take the locale into account.
